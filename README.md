# treehouse-FSJSTechDegree-Project05

In this project, I built an employee directory for Awesome Startup, a fictional company, using Random User Generator API to grab information for 12 random "employees" and display it in a grid. When an image or name is clicked, a modal window will open with more details about the employee.
