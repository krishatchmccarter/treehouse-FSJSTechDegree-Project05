My Treehouse FSJS TechDegree Project 5 - Public API Requests

In this project, I built an employee directory for Awesome Startup, a fictional company. This project uses Javascript, Fetch API and a public API (https://randomuser.me/). Fetch is used to request results for 12 random "employees" and Javascript is used to dynamically update the HTML to display those results in a grid. When an image or name inthe grid is clicked, a modal window will open with more details about the employee.
